        This website is to showcase some of my goals and things I've done so far

      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <img src="vybin logo.png" alt="Vybin Network Logo" />
      <p>
        I've always been surrounded by friends in programming, but while it
        always interested me, I was worried I wouldn't be able to learn it, so I
        ended going down another path in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        An experience I've had adjacent to programming is creating a small
        (failed) start-up with some friends for linking highschool esports
        players to collegiate and organizational opportunities like
        scholarships. I was responsible for networking to mentors and board
        members, and helped create some of the non-coding front end design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a few goals in mind now that I've begun my programming journey:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finish LaunchCode</li>
        <li>
          Continue learning and developing marketable and technical skills
        </li>
        <li>Tie my current skillset in with programming</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="part-2">
      <h2>Chicken</h2>
      
        <img

          alt="Chicken and Egg"
        />
          <p>
            I handle chickens by profession, graduated from University of Missouri
          </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently I work for a poultry company focused on SPF egg production,
        which are eggs specifically used for creating human and animal health
        vaccinations
      </p>

    <div id="part-3">
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <div class="powerlifting">
        <h3>Powerlifting</h3>
        <img src="lazy lifter.png" alt="Lazy Lifter Logo" />
        <p>
          Different from Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting is 3 main lifts...
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Squat</li>
            <li>Bench</li>
            <li>Deadlift</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          The main purpose is to use technique and strength to move as much weight
          as possible in those 3 lifts. It's easy to pick up, but technical enough
          to keep it interesting. Powerlifting also helps develop a strong
          foundation of strength and health.

    <div class="gaming">
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up on video games, starting with the Super Nintendo playing Super
        Mario Bros and NBA Jam, and then working through everything between then
        and now... N64, GameCube, Gameboy, Wii, Switch, Playstation 1/2, PSP,
        Xbox, Xbox 360, and now the computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays I only play games on the computer, and I'm sure like most of
        us, our responsibilities have increased, making it harder to find time
        for the things we enjoy, but I still try to make as much time as I can!
